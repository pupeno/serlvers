Serlvers
========

Introduction
------------

Serlvers is a set of Erlang modules designed to help in the implementation of IP services (that is TCP/IP or Internet servers).

A set of behaviours would abstract the internals of each protocol and other modules help with the infrastructure.

The goal is that when making a server you would only worry about how to store, handle, prosses, etc the information instead of the internals of each protocol (to save you for countless hours of RFC reading).

At this stage only 4 protocols are supported and they are a bit useless:

- Echo (RFC862)
- Chargen (RFC864)
- Daytime (RFC867)
- Time (RFC868)

but they are here for a purpose: To be an example and a prof of concep.

They are examples of how a protocol is implemented but they are also examples of the quality I am aiming with Serlvers, on code quality, on code style and on documentation quality and extension.

Requirements
------------

These are the requirements for using Serverls:

- Erlang: duh!... well I am not sure of what version, R10B7 works, but older versions are likely to work as well.
-- Stdlib 1.10: At least this version is required since behaviour_info/1 is used.
